# Midterm Time: Quiz App

Over the next few weeks, we'll work on a large scale project that you'll build from scratch! The basic requirement of the project is to build a quiz app (think Buzzfeed-esque personality quiz, trivia, or a study tool for TAC300). The basic requirements are:

* There should be at least five questions requiring answers from the user.
* The quiz should display a result at the end.
* The quiz should be visually appealing -- spend time planning what you want the app to look like and how you want it to behave, and then make it so!
* You can work on teams of up to 3. Make sure that work is split evenly; everyone should be committing code to Github from their own accounts instead of just working from one person's computer.

Schedule:

Week 1 - Plan! Choose to work in a team of up to 3 if you'd like (or work alone). Decide what kind of quiz you'll be building. Submit some basic mock-ups for the UI including what page interactions will look like.
Week 2 - Build a static UI for questions (no page interactions, just lay out your HTML and CSS).
Week 3 - Build javascript functions and objects that you think you might need to handle the quiz data.
Week 4 - Hook it all up and get it working!
